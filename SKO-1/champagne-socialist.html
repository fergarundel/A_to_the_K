  <h1>Champagne Socialist Variable</h1>
  <span class = "line"></span>
    <p>
      Champagne Socialist is a variable typeface which explores the possibilities of computational typography. Champagne Socialist attempts to experiment with the possibility of a single typeface for all applications, from a utilitarian monospaced sans-serif to an elegant and extravagant serif, and everything in-between. This more extreme use of the technology is purposefully used to explored the opportunities of the growing field and its truly variable application in the world of design. </p>

    <h2>Background & Context</h2>
    <p>The work positions itself in an ever-growing area of design with leaders such as ABC Dinamo releasing a steady flow of variable typefaces which explore variability beyond the weight and italic standards. Specifically, their recent typeface Arizona explores similar themes as my own, transitioning between a sans to sans-serif. Dennis Grauel has been another source of continuous inspiration throughout the studio. A Melbourne based designer, whose practice “aims to reflect an inquisitive mood”, Dennis’ letterforms, such as Acre and Brunswick Grotesque, remain playful while serving a functional purpose. Expressive typefaces from both Leah Maldonado and Morganne VanTorre have continued to inspire me to continue exploring the possibilities within my own typeface.   </p>
