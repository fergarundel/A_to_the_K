  <h1>Prototypetype (Projected Typeface)</h1>
  <span class = "line"></span>
    <p>
      In this assignment we were advised to design a modular typeface using found objects or materials. Creating a “system” by combining a minimal number of shapes, objects or materials to generate a large number of letterforms. Throughout my design process I heavily focused on the use of light in the creation of my letterforms through refraction and projection.

    <h2>Research & Development</h2>
    <p>When developing my concept I experimented with a variety of methods and materials when projecting the letterforms. The original idea stemmed from using a small mirror to reflect roughly cut out letterforms onto a flat wall. This allowed me to stretch and distort the letterforms using a phone flashlight, this distortion would become a focus off the typeface allowing it to become highly variable depending on how the light is position and the texture / surface the letterform is projected onto.   </p>

  <p>Through research and conversations in class I found in inspiration in <span style="color: blue">Sol LeWitt's</span> instruction-based artworks, where he had individuals, usually students or gallery workers, to construct installations based only on his instructions. Along with this work I began to look into Art Machines, machines and instruments made by humans to create art from Laurie Anderson's <span style="color:blue" class="blue">'Tape Bow Violin'</span> to <span style="color:blue">'The Library of Nonhuman Books' </span>created by Andy Simionato and Karen ann Donnachie. 
  <br><br>
  Continuing with these inspirations I began to focus heavily on the tools used in the creation project and looked into creating my own 'Type Projector' using found objects to then project and distort these letterforms in my surroundings. The projector is created by cutting a hole in a carboard box on one side and another smaller hole on the other. A sheet of paper with a cutout letterform is placed infront of the larger hole while a phone or torch is used to shine through the other side, projecting the letterform onto the surrounding surfaces. Using this approach others can implement the guidelines to create their own widely varying projected and distorted typography.</p>
